I got the amazing opportunity to work with professors and PhD students to work on the research topic: Understanding the Bystander Effect on Toxic Twitter Conversations

At the lab, I examined social issues such as the bystander effect within the Twitter community utilizing machine learning to discern user behaviors across social media platforms. After some training sessions, I used Python and R to create data models and applied decision trees for in-depth analysis that helped advance understanding of online communities and future strategies for addressing social issues through digital platforms. Through this research, I was able to gain insight into data science and machine learning, applying these technical skills to analyze social and psychological behaviors within Twitter conversations.
